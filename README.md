Tech Salary Intelligence Report (2020–2024)
Overview
This report explores global tech salary dynamics over five years, drawing from data spanning 2020 to 2024. Through a deep dive into geography, company size,
 role levels, and job types, the dashboard reveals powerful patterns behind compensation trends and market behaviors. It was developed as a Power BI visual to guide HR strategists, 
recruiters, and data-savvy tech professionals.
Total Salary Distribution by Company Size
Medium-sized companies emerged as the dominant salary contributors, totaling $877M, outperforming both:
Large companies: $68.64M
Small companies: $14.9M
This suggests that agile, scaling businesses have become compensation leaders—offering competitive pay to attract top talent, possibly due to leaner teams and faster promotion cycles.
Salary Growth Over Time
2020: $21.49M
2021: $87.43
2022: $146.55M
2023:  $697.41M (peak year)
2024:  $7.67M (sharp decline possibly mid-year data)
The surge in 2023 reflects pandemic-era digital acceleration, hiring booms, and salary inflation driven by global remote recruitment. 2024’s dip may signal early market correction, budget freezes, or incomplete Q4 data
Best-Paying Countries
United States: $840.97M
United Kingdom: $41.98M
Canada: $33.98M
Germany: $7.29M
France: $3.96M
No surprises here, the U.S. dominates tech compensation, particularly due to Silicon Valley, New York, and enterprise SaaS hotspots
 However, the UK and Canada show promising mid-tier growth for distributed and startup talent.
Experience Level Breakdown
Senior Level: $665.3M
Mid-Level: $199.36M
Executive: $48.18M
Entry-Level: $47.71M
Mid and senior professionals continue to command the bulk of salaries. Interestingly, the executive tier earns less than expected,perhaps due to narrower headcount or equity-heavy compensation beyond base salary
Work Model Comparison
Remote: $581.86M
On-site: $359.95M
Hybrid: $18.74M
Remote work clearly dominates, likely reflecting global talent pools, flexibility preferences, and cost arbitrage strategies.Hybrid is surprisingly low suggesting some companies still default to binary (remote vs on-site) classifications.
Top-Paying Tech Roles
Data Engineer: $188.91M
Data Scientist: $185.25M
Machine Learning Engineer: $111.47M
Data Analyst: $97.3M
Analytics Engineer: $38.46M
The top earners are data-centric roles. Data Engineers lead the pack, possibly due to increasing infrastructure demands in AI workflows and data pipeline scalability.
Final Observations
Medium companies are punching far above their weight in salary competitiveness.
 Remote and U.S.-based roles dominate earnings, but strategic global hiring is maturing.
Data specialists drive compensation trends, making them key hiring priorities.
2023 was a compensation high-water mark, and current correction phases suggest tighter budgeting or market saturation.
Conclusion
This analysis offers a snapshot of tech's evolving compensation ecosystem, shaped by a global pandemic, remote revolutions, and an insatiable demand for data talent. 
Companies hoping to stay competitive must rethink hiring models, compensation packages, and retention strategies
Job seekers, in turn, can use these insights to target roles, skills, and geographies that offer the strongest ROI.
